## ReadMe 2 has information on running this website on a server<br>

To run Client-Side <br>
1. cd CLIENT/ <br>
2. npm start <br>

The Client side is hooked up to localhost:3000/<br>

To run Server-Side open new bash, leave client running <br>
1. cd SERVER/<br>
2. npm start <br>

Head to web browser open new tab type localhost:3001/<br>
you will see Express , welcome to express, In my Server workspace there are routes comment.js, login.js, user.js
these routes are used in place of the 3001/login , 3001/users they will show you the data stored in the database


## Starting up app

Ensure you have node.js installed and can run npm commands, to be safe go to terminal and type <br>
**npm install**<br>
**npm start** <br>

### Side Notes <br>

1. All css is stored in a public folder in my client work space called main.css
2. mySQL files sit in the top level of this repo there are 2 files one called Insert.sql and one called WebAPIprocedures.sql <br>
these are needed for the Server-side to give you data back when logging in and saves the comments to the DB. You must craete a database then run these queries. You will need to make changes to the utils.js in the client>components folder and place your own host, username, password, database
