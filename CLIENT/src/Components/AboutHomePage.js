    <h1 className="aboutTitle">Your Adventure Starts Here!</h1>

    <p>If your thrills come from being on or near the water, then a canyoning expedition or a white-water adventure should definitely be on the cards! Nelson Tasman has some of the best canyoning experiences in the country, 
        where you can abseil down granite canyons and spectacular waterfalls, zip through 
        unspoiled rainforest and land in some of the purest water in Aotearoa.</p>

    <p>Nelson Tasman is also home to the Murchison township, which sits on the Four Rivers Plain — the meeting point for the Mangles, Matiri, Matakitaki, and Buller rivers. 
        Together they form the largest free-flowing catchment of water in New Zealand. It’s here that you’ll find the best white water rafting, white water kayaking, and jetboating all year round! 
        Jetboating the Buller River at 85 km/hour is an exhilarating 40 minutes of pure thrill and high-speed action with sharp turns, V8 powered spins and rapids.</p>
